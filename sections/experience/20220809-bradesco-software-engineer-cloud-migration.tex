\begin{itemize}
  \item Built a pipeline platform to unlock cloud migration, adding YAML-driven Pipeline-as-Code and one-click SDLC self-service on a legacy toolchain; cut new-stack enablement from \textbf{2+ months to under 1 week} for \textbf{Azure and IBM OpenShift}.
  \item Engineered a Pipeline-as-Code engine that versioned pipelines in Git and reconciled desired state across CI/CD and quality tooling (Bamboo, Bitbucket, SonarQube, Nexus), standardizing delivery on legacy systems.
  \item Delivered one-click SDLC self-service through an internal developer portal, eliminating weeks of manual setup for pipelines and core delivery tooling and reducing project onboarding from \textbf{weeks to days}.
  \item Defined enterprise code-quality standards for continuous assurance; benchmarked against peers/industry and implemented tiered SonarQube profiles and quality gates by application scope and criticality.
  \item Drove tooling evaluations and vendor-backed POCs; enabled contracting and rollout for the Azure and IBM OpenShift cloud migration program.
\end{itemize}
