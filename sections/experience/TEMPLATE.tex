% - Lead with your most impressive achievement
% - Use past tense for previous jobs, present tense for current role
% - Be specific with technologies, tools, and methodologies used
% - Quantify impact whenever possible (users, revenue, time saved, etc.)
% - Show progression of responsibility across roles
% - Avoid jargon that's too company-specific
% - Keep bullet points concise (1-2 lines each)
